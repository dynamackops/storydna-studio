# StoryDNA Studio

**An AI creative director for solo AI filmmakers.**

> Keep your voice. Lose the production chaos.

[Live application](https://storydnastudio.netlify.app) · [Build documentation](#build-documentation)

StoryDNA Studio turns a poem, script, lyric, story, or rough concept into a clarified creative intention and a production-ready visual plan. Unlike tools that generate immediately, it interprets the source first, asks exactly three consequential questions, and lets the creator approve the direction before scenes or prompts are produced.

## Why StoryDNA Studio

Solo AI filmmakers work across image generators, video models, voice tools, music tools, and editors. The difficult part is maintaining one emotional and visual intention across every handoff.

StoryDNA Studio is the connective creative layer. It keeps the creator's original source, the AI's interpretation, creator corrections, and approved decisions distinct—and carries the approved direction through production without silently overwriting it.

## The workflow

**Story → DNA → Scenes → Images → Motion → Review**

1. **Story intake** — Capture the source, visual vibe, character direction, aspect ratio, runtime, and preferred tools.
2. **StoryDNA analysis** — Identify emotional truth, audience feeling, themes, symbols, visual language, sensory direction, interpretation risks, and the emotional arc without generating scenes yet.
3. **Three adaptive questions** — Resolve exactly three ambiguities that would materially alter the film. The creator can answer, add context, correct the interpretation, or request a different set.
4. **Confirmed creative brief** — Turn creator decisions into an editable north star, then protect it through explicit approval.
5. **Editable scene outline** — Edit, add, delete, reorder, or regenerate one scene while stable IDs preserve unaffected work.
6. **Image prompts** — Produce editable detailed and short prompts, alternate framing, negative instructions, aspect ratio, and continuity anchors for every approved scene.
7. **Motion plans** — Add a local still reference and creator notes, then build editable camera, subject, environment, expression, timing, transition, and negative-motion direction.
8. **Production estimate** — Calculate transparent minimum, expected, and high-retry generation ranges from duration, attempts, and shot difficulty.
9. **Director's Commentary** — Compare timestamped visual samples from a finished clip with the source, approved brief, emotional arc, and scene plan.
10. **Export** — Download the complete director's packet as Markdown or versioned JSON.

## Product principles

- **Listen before generating.** Analysis and clarification happen before scene planning.
- **Creator decisions are authoritative.** Corrections and answers override provisional AI interpretation.
- **Approval has meaning.** Approved briefs and outlines become protected downstream context.
- **Regeneration is surgical.** Stable IDs let one scene or prompt change without rebuilding unaffected work.
- **Claims stay honest.** Estimates do not invent current pricing, and video critique is described as sampled-frame analysis.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UI[React + TypeScript UI] --> Store[Zustand local persistence]
    UI --> API[/api/story operations]
    API --> Router[Shared validated router]
    Router --> OpenAI[OpenAI Responses API]
    OpenAI --> Zod[Structured Outputs + Zod]
    UI --> Frames[Browser-side frame sampling]
    Frames --> API
    Store --> Export[Markdown + JSON export]
```

### Client

- React, TypeScript, and Vite
- Zustand with local-storage persistence for one active project
- Responsive cinematic interface with hand-authored CSS
- Browser-local image previews and video-frame sampling
- Client-side Markdown and JSON exports

### AI and server boundary

- Current OpenAI JavaScript SDK
- Responses API with `responses.parse`
- Structured Outputs generated from shared Zod schemas
- Separate operations for analysis, questions, briefing, scenes, image prompts, motion, and commentary
- One shared router used by local Vite middleware and the production Netlify Function
- Server-only API credentials and model configuration

The default model is the explicit [`gpt-5.6-sol`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/latest-model) flagship slug. A configured `gpt-5.6` alias is normalized to that slug before a request is sent.

### Deterministic operations

Production estimates are calculated from visible project assumptions rather than another model call. Exports are created locally and require no additional API request.

## Director's Commentary privacy boundary

The complete finished clip remains in the browser. StoryDNA Studio decodes it locally and samples up to eight evenly spaced JPEG frames at a maximum working width of 640 pixels. Only those timestamped samples, clip metadata, creator notes, and approved project context cross the API boundary.

Audio, dialogue, music, and continuous frame-to-frame motion are not analyzed in this MVP. The saved report persists locally; the uploaded video and sampled frames do not.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 22 and an optional OpenAI API key.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:4173>.

To use the live OpenAI path, configure the server-only values in `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol
```

Never prefix the key with `VITE_`, expose it in frontend code, or commit `.env` files.

Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the app runs in clearly labeled guided-demo mode. The deterministic demo director uses the same schemas and exercises the complete interface without pretending that a model call occurred.

## Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run smoke:api
```

Current verified baseline:

- TypeScript typecheck passes
- 25 tests pass across 7 test files
- Production Vite build passes
- Shared request and response schemas cover every structured operation

The smoke test expects the development server to be running with guided-demo mode active.

## Deploy to Netlify

The repository contains:

- A production Netlify Function for `/api/story/*`
- `npm run build` and `dist` configuration
- Node.js 22 pinning
- SPA refresh fallback
- Request payload guards and baseline response-security headers

Follow the [Netlify deployment guide](docs/hackathon-build/deploy-netlify.md). Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol` in Netlify's server-side environment settings, then trigger a fresh deploy.

## Current MVP boundaries

- StoryDNA Studio creates production direction and prompts; it does not directly generate images or videos.
- One active project is stored in the current browser. Authentication and cloud project storage are not implemented.
- Motion-reference images are local previews and are not sent for pixel analysis.
- Director's Commentary analyzes sampled visual frames, not audio or continuous motion.
- One finished clip is reviewed at a time.
- Credit totals appear only when the creator supplies a sample rate; no live provider pricing is included.
- PDF, ZIP, embedded-asset, and share-link exports are deferred.

## How Jasmine and Codex collaborated

StoryDNA Studio was built as an iterative collaboration between Jasmine Mack and Codex—not as a one-shot generated application.

### Jasmine's product, creative, and design decisions

Jasmine defined the product vision, the solo AI filmmaker audience, and the core promise: **“Keep your voice. Lose the production chaos.”** She made the decisions that shaped the experience:

- The product must listen and interpret before generating production material.
- It must ask exactly three adaptive questions about choices that could materially change the film.
- Creators must be able to correct the AI's interpretation and approve an editable creative brief before scenes are generated.
- The interface should feel cinematic and imaginative rather than like a dashboard or generic chatbot.
- A complete, demonstrable creative workflow mattered more than authentication, payments, or a large database.
- Typography and working text needed a readability pass without losing the visual identity.
- Director's Commentary was prioritized as the final creative loop before submission infrastructure.

Jasmine reviewed the product milestone by milestone in the running application, tested each newly unlocked stage, reported interaction and deployment failures, selected what to build next, and made the final deployment and submission decisions.

### Where Codex accelerated the workflow

Codex translated those decisions into small, verified milestones and kept implementation, tests, and documentation moving together. Its contributions included:

- Auditing the greenfield repository and creating the scope, PRD, technical specification, checklist, and running build notes.
- Designing a provenance-aware architecture that separates original source, provisional AI interpretation, creator corrections, confirmed decisions, and generated production artifacts.
- Implementing the React/TypeScript interface, Zustand persistence, shared Zod contracts, server-only OpenAI boundary, and deterministic guided-demo path.
- Building each vertical slice independently: analysis, questions, creative brief, scenes, image prompts, motion plans, estimates, export, and Director's Commentary.
- Protecting unaffected work through stable scene IDs and isolated scene and image-prompt regeneration.
- Adding contract, estimator, export, video-sampling, model-configuration, and Netlify-function tests.
- Diagnosing API quota and model-resolution errors, visible error handling, Netlify repository configuration, serverless function naming, and multimodal payload limits.
- Refining responsive behavior, typography, contrast, privacy copy, technical limitations, deployment documentation, and Devpost materials.

The working loop was consistent: Jasmine set the goal and judged the experience; Codex proposed or implemented the smallest next milestone; automated checks and browser verification tested it; Jasmine reviewed the live result and chose the next priority.

### How GPT-5.6 contributes to the product

GPT-5.6 is the application's structured creative-direction runtime. It is used through focused operations rather than one monolithic prompt:

- StoryDNA analysis without premature scene generation
- Exactly three adaptive clarification questions
- Editable creative-brief synthesis from creator-approved decisions
- Scene outlining and isolated scene regeneration
- Scene-linked image-prompt generation and isolated prompt regeneration
- Image-to-video motion direction
- Sampled-frame Director's Commentary against the approved project context

The Responses API returns schema-validated Structured Outputs for each operation. Prompts label creator corrections, answers, and approved briefs as authoritative so the model cannot silently treat its first interpretation as the final creative decision.

### Primary Codex build thread

The majority of the core functionality was built in the Codex thread **“Kick Off StoryDNA Studio MVP.”**
