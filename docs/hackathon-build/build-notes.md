# StoryDNA Studio — Build Notes

Running log for product decisions, scope cuts, bugs, verification, and submission-ready Codex contributions.

## 2026-07-18 — Kickoff and repository audit

### Decisions made

- Treat the workspace as greenfield: it contained no files, package metadata, Git repository, or local agent instructions.
- Use one React/Vite/TypeScript repository with a thin server-only API boundary.
- Keep `OPENAI_MODEL` configurable and document `gpt-5.6` as the example after confirming the official model listing.
- Use the Responses API with Structured Outputs and shared Zod validation.
- Keep the OpenAI API key server-only.
- Provide a clearly labeled deterministic demo mode when no key is configured, so the hackathon walkthrough remains reliable.
- Use Zustand local persistence for one active project.
- Use hand-authored design tokens/CSS in the initial slice to avoid introducing a utility layer before components stabilize.

### Features cut or deferred

- Authentication, Supabase, uploads, motion, estimates, Director's Commentary, exports, and deployment are deferred until the day-one creation loop works.
- The first implementation stops after StoryDNA analysis and exactly three clarification questions.

### Bugs encountered

- The official OpenAI Docs MCP connector was not installed. It was installed successfully, but newly installed MCP tools require a new Codex session; current model guidance was therefore checked through the skill's official-domain web fallback.
- The direct latest-model Markdown fetch returned an upstream fetch error; the official model catalog search result supplied the current model ID and capability confirmation.

### Verification results

- Repository audit: complete; empty workspace confirmed.
- Official model documentation: `gpt-5.6` alias and Responses API/Structured Outputs support confirmed on 2026-07-18.
- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused unit/contract tests: 4 passed across 2 test files.
- Production Vite build: passed (102 modules transformed).
- Live API smoke: analysis schema valid; exactly 3 questions; invalid input returns HTTP 400; guided-demo mode confirmed.
- Interactive browser: full intake → analysis → questions workflow passed.
- Question regeneration: replaced only the three-question set while preserving the existing analysis.
- Local persistence: selected answer restored after reload and all three question cards remained present.
- Responsive check: 390×844 viewport had no horizontal body overflow; analysis collapsed to one column; question cards used the intended compact two-column layout; stage navigation remained horizontally scrollable.
- Browser console: no warnings or errors.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Converted an expansive product vision into a staged, testable scope with explicit release gates.
- Designed a provenance-aware AI architecture that keeps source, interpretation, corrections, and approved decisions separate.
- Added a demo-resilient architecture that protects API credentials and still supports reliable judging without production infrastructure.
- Delivered a polished cinematic interface and complete first vertical slice with observable AI-operation state, correction affordances, and protected creator decisions.

### Bugs encountered during implementation

- Initial local server startup was blocked by the managed sandbox's socket policy; starting the same scoped `npm run dev` command with approval resolved it.
- TypeScript initially lacked Vite's CSS side-effect import declarations. Adding `src/vite-env.d.ts` fixed both typecheck and build.
- The browser's screenshot command timed out, so responsive verification used live DOM/accessibility inspection and computed layout measurements instead. Functional browser verification was unaffected.

## 2026-07-18 — Confirmed creative brief milestone

### Decisions made

- Added `createCreativeBrief` as a third independent structured AI operation rather than expanding either analysis or question generation.
- Labeled creator answers, corrections, and extra context as authoritative in the prompt; creator corrections explicitly override the unapproved AI interpretation.
- Made six brief sections editable before approval: intention, emotional destination, visual identity, character direction, constraints, and consistency requirements.
- Added an explicit provenance trail from original voice through interpretation and creator decisions to the brief.
- Approval converts the brief to read-only state and persists an approval timestamp. The UI exposes no silent regeneration path after approval.
- Scene generation remains visibly locked as the next milestone.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck and production build: passed.
- Focused schema/demo tests: 6 passed across 2 files.
- Browser workflow: three answers → generated brief → edit → approval passed.
- Generated brief contained all six required editable sections.
- Approval converted every brief field to read-only state.
- Edited intention and approval state both survived browser refresh.
- Mobile 390×844 check: no horizontal overflow; fields, provenance, and approval actions collapsed to one column.
- Browser console: no warnings or errors.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Implemented the product's central trust mechanism: AI interpretation becomes an editable artifact, while creator-approved decisions become protected production context.
- Added a visual provenance model that makes the distinction between source, AI reading, user decisions, and confirmed direction understandable at a glance.

### OpenAI runtime configuration

- Added a server-only local API key through the Git-ignored `.env` file; no credential was added to tracked source.
- Added a non-secret `/api/story/status` health response and header indicator so creators can distinguish `OpenAI ready` from guided-demo mode.
- Verified the running Vite server reloaded the configuration and displayed `OpenAI ready` in the application header.

## 2026-07-18 — Editable scene outline milestone

### Decisions made

- Added `generateSceneOutline` as a separate structured operation that accepts only an approved creative brief as authoritative direction.
- Added isolated `regenerateScene` handling that forcibly preserves the target scene ID and position and receives neighboring scenes as continuity context only.
- Normalized positions after every add, delete, or reorder operation while leaving stable IDs unchanged.
- Kept creator-added scenes local and immediately editable with unique `scene-local-*` IDs.
- Approval removes edit, reorder, regenerate, add, and delete controls and persists an approval timestamp.
- Image prompt generation remains visibly locked as Milestone 7.

### Bugs encountered

- The live OpenAI request reached the API but returned HTTP 429 quota exceeded. The key and server integration are connected, but the account requires available billing/quota before real generations can complete.
- Demo regeneration initially produced double punctuation when a creator note already ended with punctuation; the note is now normalized before composition.
- Git commit creation remains blocked inside Codex because `.git/index.lock` cannot be written under the current managed permission profile.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused contract/demo tests: 8 passed across 2 files.
- Production build: passed.
- Guided browser workflow generated 8 scenes with 8 unique stable IDs.
- Edit, add, delete, and reorder operations: passed.
- Isolated scene regeneration changed the target scene, preserved all IDs, and left the sampled unaffected scene byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Outline approval made every scene field read-only and removed all mutation controls.
- Approved ordering and an edited story beat survived browser refresh.
- Mobile 390×844 check: no horizontal overflow; scene fields and approval controls collapsed correctly; stage navigation remained scrollable.
- Browser console: no warnings or errors.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Built a surgical regeneration architecture that avoids the common AI-product failure of rebuilding—and potentially damaging—unaffected creative work.
- Made the production plan feel like an editable film document rather than a chatbot transcript, with visible runtime, scene identity, emotional purpose, and approval state.

## 2026-07-18 — Readability pass

### Decisions made

- Raised the general microcopy floor from 7–10px to 11–12px across navigation, metadata, labels, status indicators, buttons, and helper text.
- Increased scene and creative-brief working copy to 14px while preserving larger editorial headings and story-beat typography.
- Brightened previously low-contrast secondary text without changing the dark cinematic palette.
- Reduced excessive letter spacing on small uppercase labels so the larger type remains compact and readable.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck and production build: passed.
- Desktop check: no horizontal overflow; navigation 12px, status 11px, primary actions 12px, scene labels 11px.
- Mobile 390×844 check: no horizontal overflow or clipped buttons; navigation and API status remain 11px.

## 2026-07-18 — Image prompt workspace milestone

### Decisions made

- Kept GPT-5.6 as the core runtime provider because the OpenAI Build Week rules require entrants to build with Codex and GPT-5.6. Groq or Anthropic may supplement the product later, but will not replace the judged GPT-5.6 path.
- Preserved guided demo mode as the no-cost and quota-safe walkthrough fallback; the real OpenAI path remains server-only and uses the configured model environment variable.
- Added `generateImagePrompts` as a separate structured operation that accepts the approved brief and approved ordered scenes.
- Linked every image prompt to a stable `sceneId` and added an independent prompt ID so downstream motion work can attach without positional coupling.
- Included detailed prompt, short prompt, alternate framing, negative instructions, aspect ratio, and observable consistency anchors in the validated schema.
- Added isolated `regenerateImagePrompt`; both the server and store forcibly preserve prompt ID, scene ID, and aspect ratio.
- Kept every prompt editable after generation and added one-click copy feedback without adding provider-specific image generation yet.

### Features cut

- No direct image-provider API integration in this milestone; creators copy prompts into their preferred image tool.
- No provider selector or Groq/Anthropic fallback yet. Provider abstraction is deferred until after the required end-to-end OpenAI demo is submission-ready.
- No image uploads or motion plans; those remain the next milestone.

### Bugs encountered

- Live OpenAI generation remains blocked by HTTP 429 account quota, so the judged path requires API billing/quota before demo recording.
- The managed Codex shell cannot bind a new localhost port (`EPERM`). Moving the environment file triggered the user-started Vite process to stop; the file was immediately restored, but the user must restart `npm run dev` in Terminal.
- Local Terminal control is blocked by the desktop safety boundary, so Codex could not restart the user-owned process through the GUI.
- When the local server was unavailable, image-prompt generation correctly failed but the approved Scenes screen did not render the stored error, making the button appear unresponsive. Added a visible production-step error with restart guidance.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused schema/demo tests: 10 passed across 2 files.
- Production build: passed.
- Structured demo generation produced one prompt per approved scene in identical scene order.
- Every demo prompt inherited the requested aspect ratio and approved consistency requirements.
- Isolated prompt regeneration preserved prompt ID and scene ID while changing only the target prompt.
- Browser could inspect the existing approved-scene state and confirmed the Images action is now enabled. Final live Images visual verification is pending a user restart of the local Vite process.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Extended the product's surgical-regeneration promise from scenes into production prompts, protecting unaffected creative work and stable downstream references.
- Turned approved direction into visibly traceable prompt ingredients—emotion, framing, atmosphere, aspect ratio, and character continuity—rather than relying on a generic one-line generator prompt.
- Verified the official competition requirement before making a provider decision, retaining GPT-5.6 as the eligible core while preserving a reliable guided demo fallback.

## 2026-07-18 — Motion workspace milestone

### Decisions made

- Added `generateMotionPrompt` as a separate structured, scene-level AI operation instead of folding motion into image prompt generation.
- Motion plans retain stable `motion-{sceneId}` identities and never rebuild plans for unaffected scenes.
- Added browser-local still previews with a 10 MB guard. Image pixels are not uploaded or sent to the text-planning API; only the optional filename and creator-authored motion notes are included as context.
- Made all production direction editable: intended action, camera movement, subject movement, environmental movement, facial expression, clip duration, final prompt, negative motion instructions, transition, and suggested capability category.
- Avoided exact model pricing or unsupported tool-specific promises. Suggested models are expressed as capability categories.
- Added a back-to-images control that preserves completed motion plans, allowing creators to revise prompts without losing downstream work.
- Expanded `.gitignore` to cover `.env*` backups while explicitly keeping `.env.example`, preventing the guided-demo key backup from entering a commit.

### Features cut

- No pixel-level image analysis in this milestone; the upload is a private visual reference for the creator.
- Uploaded preview data is intentionally session-only and must be re-selected after refresh to avoid localStorage quota failures.
- Direct video generation remains outside the MVP; the workspace produces tool-ready prompts.

### Bugs encountered

- Existing `.env.openai` was initially visible as an untracked file after the guided-demo rename. The ignore rule now protects all environment variants.
- A network failure on the approved Scenes screen previously appeared silent; the screen now renders a visible restart/action error.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused schema/demo tests: 12 passed across 2 files.
- Production build: passed.
- Live guided-demo browser flow opened Motion from eight image prompts and generated one complete scene-linked plan.
- Creator motion notes propagated into the final image-to-video prompt.
- Refresh persistence passed for the completed plan, its creator note, duration, and editable fields.
- Mobile 390×844 check: no horizontal overflow; setup and direction grids collapse to one 324px column; working copy remains 13–14px with 11px labels.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Extended StoryDNA's protected-decision chain through motion, so emotional intent becomes concrete camera, performance, environment, and transition direction.
- Made the privacy boundary honest and visible: local image reference versus text context sent for planning.
- Added model-agnostic negative motion guidance focused on common AI-video failure modes such as identity drift, morphing, flicker, and uncontrolled camera movement.

## 2026-07-18 — Production estimate milestone

### Decisions made

- Implemented production estimating as a deterministic calculator rather than another model operation, making every total explainable and immediately responsive to configuration changes.
- Added persisted assumptions for platform label, expected attempts per scene, and optional sample credits per generation.
- Kept credit totals completely hidden until the creator configures a sample rate; no provider pricing is hardcoded or presented as current.
- Classified shots as low, medium, or high difficulty from visible signals: complex visual elements, continuity-sensitive anatomy/faces, coordinated motion, and longer clip duration.
- Exposed the reason for every difficulty label and calculated per-shot expected/high-retry generations.
- Added a return path to motion plans without losing estimate configuration.

### Features cut

- No live provider pricing lookup or exact credit claims.
- No AI-generated difficulty score; deterministic heuristics are easier to inspect and defend in a hackathon demo.
- Export remains the next product milestone.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused tests: 14 passed across 3 files.
- Production build: passed.
- Live estimate for eight approved scenes: 64-second runtime, 8 minimum generations, and configuration-sensitive expected/high-retry ranges.
- Changing expected attempts from 3 to 4 recalculated totals from 31/54 to 39/62 immediately.
- Configuring a five-credit sample rate produced a clearly labeled 40–310 sample range; removing the rate hides all credit totals.
- Platform, attempts, credit rate, and totals survived refresh.
- Mobile 390×844 check: no horizontal overflow; estimate configuration and ranges collapse to one column; shot rows remain readable.
- Browser console: no warnings or errors.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Turned production uncertainty into a defensible planning range instead of false precision.
- Made difficult AI-video shots visible before generation, helping solo filmmakers budget retries where continuity and coordinated motion are most fragile.
- Preserved trust by separating user-configured sample credits from live provider pricing claims.

## 2026-07-18 — Production plan export milestone

### Decisions made

- Added two client-only handoff formats: a readable Markdown director's packet and versioned structured JSON for future imports.
- Kept every stage traceable in the packet: original source, AI interpretation, creator questions and answers, corrections, approved brief, scenes, image prompts, motion plans, and the current production estimate.
- Linked downstream artifacts by stable scene ID and preserved scene order.
- Normalized the project title into a safe filename and made exports without another API request.
- Explicitly excluded API credentials and browser-local image previews from exported data.

### Features cut

- PDF rendering, ZIP packaging, and embedded image assets are deferred.
- No cloud export history or share link until storage and authentication are intentionally added.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused tests: 16 passed across 4 files.
- Production build: passed.
- Markdown coverage test confirmed source, creator decisions, every production stage, estimate disclaimer, and privacy note.
- JSON coverage test confirmed the versioned structure and safe project filename.
- Live browser verification confirmed both export controls on the completed estimate screen.
- Mobile 390×844 check confirmed the export actions stack at full width with no clipped content.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Converted the full creative-director collaboration into a portable production artifact instead of leaving the result trapped in the interface.
- Preserved the provenance chain from creator voice through AI interpretation to approved production decisions.
- Kept the handoff privacy-safe by design: no secrets and no silently embedded local assets.

## 2026-07-18 — Director's Commentary milestone

### Decisions made

- Used the Responses API's supported multi-image vision input instead of claiming that the model directly watches an uploaded video.
- Decode the finished clip locally and sample up to 8 evenly spaced JPEG frames at a maximum working width of 640 pixels, keeping the request below Netlify's function payload limit.
- Keep the complete video in the browser; only timestamped frame samples, clip metadata, creator notes, and approved project context cross the API boundary.
- Added four distinct review lenses: gentle creative collaborator, direct film editor, audience reaction, and AI-video technical review.
- Added a nine-area scorecard covering narrative clarity, emotional payoff, pacing, visual consistency, character continuity, symbolism, shot duration, repetition, and transitions.
- Persist only the structured report, never the video or sampled frames, and include the latest report in future Markdown/JSON exports.

### Features cut

- Audio, dialogue, music, and continuous frame-to-frame motion analysis are explicitly outside the MVP boundary.
- No server-side video storage, transcoding pipeline, transcript generation, waveform analysis, or cloud asset history.
- One finished clip is reviewed at a time; side-by-side cut comparison is deferred.

### Bugs encountered

- Commentary state briefly returned to the estimate screen during a responsive browser reload; reopening the workspace confirmed the persisted route and mobile layout. The saved report itself remains persisted independently of local video state.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused tests: 20 passed across 5 files.
- Production build: passed.
- Validated chronological sampling across full-length and one-second clips.
- Validated complete structured guided-demo reports across all four feedback modes.
- Live browser verification confirmed the estimate-to-commentary entry point, four selectable feedback modes, disabled empty-submit state, upload boundary copy, and back navigation.
- Mobile 390×844 check confirmed single-column modes, full-width upload and notes controls, readable 13px working copy, and no clipped action controls.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Added a genuinely closed creative loop: StoryDNA can now compare the planned emotional intention with visible evidence from the creator's finished cut.
- Kept the multimodal claim technically honest by documenting sampled-frame vision and its audio/motion limitations directly in the product.
- Turned broad critique into production-ready revision priorities tied to the creator's approved decisions rather than generic filmmaking advice.

## 2026-07-21 — Netlify deployment hardening

### Decisions made

- Extracted one shared server operation router so local Vite middleware and the production Netlify Function use identical validation, demo fallback, provenance, and AI operations.
- Added a TypeScript Netlify Function with custom `/api/story/*` routing, no-store JSON responses, content-type checks, body limits, and server-only environment access.
- Added committed Netlify build configuration for `npm run build`, `dist`, the functions directory, Node.js 22, SPA refresh fallback, and baseline security headers.
- Reduced Director's Commentary to eight 640-pixel JPEG samples at controlled quality so its JSON request stays below Netlify's 6 MB buffered payload limit.
- Kept guided-demo mode functional on production deployments without an API key.

### Bugs encountered

- The first Netlify deploy cloned a repository with no root `package.json`. Local inspection confirmed this project has the file committed but has no Git remote, so Netlify was connected to a different or empty repository.
- The attempted `git remote add` and push were run from the macOS home directory and used the placeholder GitHub URL literally, producing `not a git repository` before any remote could be configured.
- Netlify initially treated `netlify/functions/story.test.ts` as a second serverless function named `story.test`, then rejected the dot in that function name. Moved the test beside the server tests so only `story.mts` is deployed.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused tests: 22 passed across 6 files.
- Production Vite build: passed.
- Direct production-function tests passed for `/api/story/status` and a complete validated guided-demo `/api/story/analyze` request.
- Netlify configuration, serverless function, shared router, SPA fallback, environment names, and payload guards are committed-source ready.
- The managed Codex shell cannot connect to the user-owned localhost port (`EPERM`), so the existing external smoke script could not run from this sandbox; the same route logic passed through direct function invocation.
- The final external gate is connecting the real GitHub repository, deploying with the documented settings, and running the public guided-demo/API smoke path.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Carried the exact structured AI workflow from local development into a secure production function instead of exposing the API key or shipping a static-only demo.
- Identified and mitigated a platform payload limit before it could make the showcase commentary feature fail only in production.

## 2026-07-21 — Devpost submission audit

### Decisions made

- Used the repository, deployed interface, test suite, and existing verification log as the factual boundary for submission language.
- Documented explicit MVP limitations rather than implying direct image/video generation, continuous video understanding, audio analysis, cloud project storage, or current provider pricing.
- Prepared a complete Devpost draft, three-minute demo script, README recommendations, screenshot/GIF plan, and prioritized judging polish list in `docs/hackathon-build/devpost-submission.md`.

### Bugs encountered

- The deployed application loaded successfully and reported `OpenAI ready`, but a fresh demo-story analysis returned `400 unable to find suitable provider for gpt-5.6`. Production model access/configuration must be repaired or the deployment must intentionally use the clearly labeled guided-demo path before judges test it.

### Verification results

- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused tests: 22 passed across 6 files.
- Production Vite build: passed with 105 transformed modules.
- Deployed intake UI: loaded successfully and accepted the included demo poem.
- Deployed OpenAI generation path: failed at the first analysis request with the model/provider error above.
- Repository audit: public remote configured; working tree was clean before adding the submission draft; no `LICENSE` file or social-preview metadata was present.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Converted the full implementation and build history into evidence-backed submission language without overstating the MVP.
- Found a judging-critical production failure during the final live audit rather than relying on the successful page load alone.
- Created a prioritized submission plan centered on the product's strongest differentiators: listening before generation, protected creator decisions, surgical regeneration, and a closed intention-to-revision loop.

## 2026-07-21 — Submission readiness repair

### Decisions made

- Replaced the ambiguous production model default with the official explicit `gpt-5.6-sol` flagship slug.
- Added a small configuration resolver that maps a lingering `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.6` Netlify value to `gpt-5.6-sol` while preserving any other explicitly configured model ID.
- Added an MIT license under Jasmine Mack's name and expanded the README into a submission-ready project page with product differentiation, workflow, architecture, trust model, setup, verification, limitations, deployment, and Codex/GPT-5.6 attribution.

### Bugs encountered

- The improved README initially linked to a nonexistent documentation index; the link now targets the README's own build-documentation section.

### Verification results

- Model configuration regression coverage: alias, whitespace, default, and custom-model preservation passed.
- Netlify function coverage confirmed that `gpt-5.6` is reported as the resolved `gpt-5.6-sol` model.
- TypeScript typecheck: passed.
- Focused tests: 25 passed across 7 files.
- Production Vite build: passed with 105 transformed modules.
- Public verification remains pending the required commit, push, and Netlify redeploy.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Traced the production failure to an alias/provider-resolution boundary and applied the narrowest documented model configuration fix.
- Added regression coverage so a stale deployment environment value cannot reintroduce the same alias error.
- Turned the repository landing page into an accurate product narrative while preserving explicit MVP limitations.

## 2026-07-21 — Codex collaboration documentation

### Decisions made

- Expanded the README's brief tooling acknowledgement into an explicit collaboration narrative for Devpost judging.
- Separated Jasmine's product, creative, prioritization, testing, and design decisions from Codex's planning, architecture, implementation, verification, debugging, deployment, and documentation acceleration.
- Documented GPT-5.6 as the application's structured runtime rather than conflating it with Codex's software-development role.
- Added the primary build thread ID to the public README for easy submission reference.

### Verification results

- Confirmed the primary StoryDNA build thread title, workspace, and ID through the local Codex thread index.
- Primary build thread ID: `019f7433-c3d4-7173-9c9a-a45375b897d4`.

### Codex contributions useful for Devpost

- Produced a concrete, evidence-backed account of the human–Codex working loop instead of a generic “built with AI” claim.
- Connected product decisions and implementation outcomes to the milestone history judges can verify in the repository.
